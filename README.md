# THE DESCRIPTION ABOUT THE TASK THAT I HAVE DONE

# The analysis deals with Big Data Processing & Insight Extraction. The dataset that i have used for analysis is  USvideos.csv (YouTube Trending Videos) and the source for editing that been used is  Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda). The programming language used is Python and tool used is PySpark.
# The main objective of the analysis was to perform big data analysis using scalable tools such as PySpark or Dask. PySpark was chosen for its compatibility with large datasets and distributed processing capabilities. The goal was to load a large dataset, clean it, analyze it, and derive useful business or user insights from it all within a PySpark session. The dataset used was the US YouTube Trending Videos dataset, a real-world dataset containing data on trending videos across categories which includes 40,000+ rows and other
# This dataset is ideal for Aggregation, Filtering, Grouping operations and analysing user engagement. PySpark was used for processing and analysis, demonstrating scalability.The libraries used here are pyspark.sql, SparkSession, functions like col, avg etc.
# The successful completion of analysis marked a significant step in applying big data techniques to real-world datasets using PySpark. By utilizing PySpark, we were able to read and process the dataset efficiently, perform essential data cleaning, and extract valuable insights. We explored various key metrics such as the most viewed videos, most liked content, and average likes by video category. These operations were performed using PySpark’s built-in SQL-like functions such as select, groupBy, agg, and orderBy, which allowed for clean and readable code while handling large volumes of data. One of the most important observations derived from the analysis was that Music and Entertainment categories consistently attracted the highest number of views and likes. The top trending video, “Despacito”,  recorded more than 200 million views, emphasizing the massive engagement levels in the music category. In addition, the average like counts per category highlighted the user preferences and engagement patterns on YouTube. This analysis clearly demonstrated how big data tools like PySpark empower analysts to work with large datasets in a scalable, fast, and efficient manner. It also reinforced the importance of using distributed computing frameworks for exploratory data analysis and reporting. The hands-on experience gained from this task builds a strong foundation for more advanced data engineering and analytics projects in the future.
